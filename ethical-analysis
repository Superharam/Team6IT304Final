        <h3>Misinformation and Deception</h3>
        <p>
            Deep Fake AI allows for the creation of realistic videos and audio that are entirely fake. This has been used to spread fake news, political propaganda, and scams. Since people often believe what they see, these fakes can cause significant harm, like influencing elections or damaging trust in media.

        <h3>Privacy and Consent</h3>
        <p>
            Many Deep Fakes are made using someone’s image or voice without their permission. This can lead to reputational harm, especially in cases of inappropriate or harmful content like fake celebrity videos or revenge porn. Violating privacy in this way makes the technology highly controversial.

        <h3>Legal and Regulatory Gaps</h3>
        <p>
            Laws haven’t kept up with the rapid development of this technology, leaving many gray areas around accountability. If a Deep Fake causes harm, it’s unclear whether the responsibility lies with the creator, the platform hosting it, or the tool’s developer.

        <h3>Societal Impacts</h3>
        <p>
            Deep Fake AI erodes trust in media and communication. When people can’t distinguish real from fake, it creates doubt about everything they see and hear online. This distrust can lead to larger issues, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and a breakdown of reliable information sources.

        These challenges highlight that Deep Fake AI is not just a technical issue but a deeply ethical and social one. We must carefully consider how it is used and implement safeguards to prevent harm.

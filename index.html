        <h1>What Technology Did the Team Choose?</h1>
        <p>For this project, we decided to cover Deepfake technology. Deepfakes refer to media created using AI. Oftentimes these videos feature real people in fake situations.</p>
        <p>We chose this technology as it is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's society.</p>

        <h1>Why Does the Tech Matter?</h1>
        <p>
            Deepfakes matter because they challenge the very foundations of trust in digital media. By enabling the creation of hyper-realistic fake videos and images, 
            this technology presents opportunities for creative innovation in industries such as entertainment, education, and advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it also introduces significant risks, including the spread of disinformation, identity fraud, and violations of privacy. Deepfakes have the 
            potential to influence public opinion, manipulate political events, and harm individuals by fabricating situations that never occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
            The technology is a double-edged sword, offering both immense potential and serious ethical dilemmas. Its implications extend to politics, personal safety, 
            and media authenticity, raising urgent questions about regulation, accountability, and responsible use.
